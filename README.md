# Lab #2: Interaction and State Management

Your task in this lab is to make the todo list from the last lab interactive. (we've pre-filled the solution from the last lab, you won't have to do that again!) It should be possible to check items and to add new items.

This is what the finished app should look like:

You'll need to fill out the `TodoInput.js` component, and add some functionality to `TodoItem` and (mostly) `TodoList`.

## Testing

To make it easier for you to complete this task, we've (again) added tests verifying that you've arrived at the correct app. This command will run the tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

If you haven't changed anything you should see test failures showing you what exactly we expect the app to do. (or a "Component not found" for the `TodoInput` if you haven't created the input yet)
